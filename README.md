# The Rise of Electric Vehicles: Data-Driven Overview

## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard analyzing electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends in the United States between 2017 and 2025. Using government-sourced data, the analysis provides insights into the growth of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) across states and counties. The dashboard enables users to explore dynamic visualizations, understand consumer preferences, and identify high-adoption regions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives

1. **EV Adoption Trends Over Time**
   - Track year-wise growth of BEVs, PHEVs, and total EVs.
   - Highlight significant spikes post-2019 in line with policy shifts.

2. **EV Market Share by State and County**
   - Compare regional EV penetration rates.
   - Identify leaders like California and Washington.

3. **BEV vs. PHEV Preferences**
   - Analyze consumer leanings toward BEVs over time.
   - Assess regional variations in preference.

4. **Top 10 EV-Adopting Counties**
   - Rank counties by EV market share.
   - Showcase dominance of urban California counties.

5. **EV Growth vs. Overall Vehicle Growth**
   - Evaluate how EV registration outpaces total vehicle growth.
   - Support future mobility strategy planning.

6. **EV Adoption by Vehicle Type (Passenger vs. Truck)**
   - Understand the distribution of EVs by vehicle category.
   - Explore trends in the commercial truck segment.

7. **Forecasting Future Trends**
   - Use Excelâ€™s trendline functionality to project EV growth.
   - Provide insights for infrastructure planning and policy.

## ðŸ§  Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Data.gov - EV Population Size by County](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-size-history-by-county)
- **Fields**: Year, State, County, Fuel Type (BEV/PHEV), Vehicle Type, Total Registrations
- **Time Frame**: 2017â€“2025
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned and standardized data
  - Created new metrics (e.g., total EVs, % electric vehicles)
  - Removed anomalies and ensured formatting consistency

---

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Excel**
  - Pivot tables
  - Slicers for interactivity (State & County)
  - Conditional formatting and dynamic charts
  - Forecasting via built-in trendline functionality

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Insights Delivered

- Interactive line charts for EV trends
- Stacked bar charts by state/county
- Pie charts for BEV vs. PHEV ratios
- Horizontal bar rankings of top EV counties
- Dual-axis charts comparing EV vs total vehicle growth
- Clustered column visuals for passenger vs. truck breakdown

---

## ðŸ”® Key Findings

- BEVs are consistently outpacing PHEVs in adoption.
- Urban centers show the highest EV penetration (often >20%).
- EV growth is 5â€“8Ã— faster than overall vehicle registration in many states.
- Trucks remain a smaller but growing segment in rural areas.
